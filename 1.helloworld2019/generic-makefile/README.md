# Generic Makefile

This is a generic makefile that can be used to start any go project. It has the following make targets:

* Run
* Compile
* Clean

Just add the name and version to the `.env` file and add the both the makefile and `.env` file to the same directory as your `main.go` file. Then you should be good to _go_.

Requirements:
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) 
* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html)
